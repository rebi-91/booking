    {
      q: "How do I know which travel vaccines I need for my trip?",
      a: "Before you set off, itâ€™s important to research the specific health risks of your destination. You can check reputable sources like NHS Fit for Travel or speak with our travel clinic team at Coleshill Pharmacy for tailored advice. Weâ€™ll consider factors such as the countries youâ€™re visiting, the duration of your stay, and any planned activities. By assessing your medical history and vaccination records, we can recommend the appropriate jabs or boosters."
    },
    {
      q: "How can I book a travel clinic appointment?",
      a: "Booking an appointment at our Coleshill Pharmacy travel clinic is quick and straightforward. You can give us a ring, pop into the pharmacy, or use our online booking form if available. Our friendly team will find a convenient slot that suits your schedule. Weâ€™ll discuss your travel plans and vaccination requirements over the phone or in person, so you know exactly what to expect. Donâ€™t leave it too late â€“ allow enough time to complete your vaccinations before your departure."
    },
    {
      q: "How far in advance should I get my travel vaccinations?",
      a: "Ideally, you should visit our travel clinic at least six to eight weeks before you head off. This allows time for any vaccines to become fully effective and for multiple doses if needed. If youâ€™re travelling sooner, donâ€™t worry â€“ contact us as soon as possible, and weâ€™ll do our best to help. Some vaccines take longer to provide protection, while others may need several injections over a few weeks."
    },
    {
      q: "Is Yellow Fever vaccination available at Coleshill Pharmacy?",
      a: "No. We are not currently offering Yellow Fever vaccinations or certificates at Coleshill Pharmacy. If you require this service, you will need to visit an alternative Yellow Fever vaccination centre."
    },
    
    {
      q: "What about malaria prevention for high-risk areas?",
      a: "Malaria is a serious concern in many tropical and subtropical regions. If youâ€™re travelling to a high-risk area, weâ€™ll discuss the different antimalarial medications available and recommend the most suitable option based on your medical history and travel plans. Weâ€™ll also talk about bite prevention, such as using mosquito nets, repellents, and covering up in the evenings. Remember to start taking antimalarials before you leave, continue throughout your stay, and finish the course upon your return."
    },
    {
      q: "Can children get their travel vaccinations at Coleshill Pharmacy?",
      a: "Absolutely. We welcome families who need travel vaccinations. Our friendly pharmacist is experienced in administering immunisations to children, taking extra care to ensure they feel at ease. Weâ€™ll discuss each childâ€™s vaccination history and any unique considerations, like allergies or ongoing medical conditions. If certain vaccines arenâ€™t appropriate for a childâ€™s age, weâ€™ll advise on alternatives or the best timing. Weâ€™ll also offer practical tips on staying healthy during your family trip."
    },
    {
      q: "What do I need to bring to the travel clinic appointment?",
      a: "When you visit our travel clinic, it helps to bring as much information as possible. That includes details of your travel itinerary, such as the countries youâ€™ll visit, the length of your stay, and any activities you plan. Bring your vaccination records or a list of previous immunisations if you have them. Itâ€™s also useful to have a note of any medical conditions, current medications, or allergies. Our pharmacist will use this information to tailor your vaccination plan and advice."
    },
    {
      q: "Do travel vaccines have side effects?",
      a: "Like all vaccines, travel jabs can cause mild side effects, but serious reactions are rare. Most people experience little more than a sore arm, some redness, or slight swelling at the injection site. Occasionally, you may feel tired, develop a low-grade fever, or have minor aches and pains for a day or two. Our pharmacist will explain potential side effects during your consultation and advise on ways to manage them."
    },
    {
      q: "Can you provide certificates if required?",
      a: "We currently do not issue International Certificates of Vaccination, such as for Yellow Fever. For destinations that require these certificates, you will need to attend a registered Yellow Fever vaccination centre."
    },
    {
      q: "How can I stay healthy while travelling abroad?",
      a: "Beyond vaccinations, staying healthy abroad involves simple yet effective measures. Pack a travel first-aid kit with essentials like painkillers, plasters, antiseptic, and any personal medications. Stay hydrated, especially in hot climates, and drink bottled or purified water if the local supply isnâ€™t safe. Use insect repellent to protect against bites, and be mindful of sun protection â€“ wear sunscreen, sunglasses, and hats. When dining, stick to reputable eateries, and make sure food is properly cooked."
